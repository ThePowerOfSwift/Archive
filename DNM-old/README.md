## DNM
Dynamic Notation for Music

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jsbean/DNM.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jsbean/DNM)

iPad based music notation renderer. Work-in-progress.

### Create a file

Build and run **DNM Text Editor**. *If that doesn't work, file an issue.*

To create an account (which will enable you to transfer scores to any device), create a username and password. This will create an account within [Parse](https://github.com/ParsePlatform).

You can work offline, saving files to your computer locally. Use filename extension: `.dnm`.

When you save a file (and are logged in), the score will be saved in the cloud, to be displayed on an iPad elsewhere.

---

### Author a score

In the text file that you have just started with the **DNM Text Editor**, start by adding a title, then declaring the performers in the work.

####Add a title:
```
Title: This is my Title
```

This is the title which will show up on the iPad ScoreSelector to be chosen from by the performer.

N.B.: Richer metadata to be added over time (Composer, Dates, Ensembles, notes for Electronics, etc.).

####Declare Performers

Use the `P:` command, followed by an alphanumeric `String` to declare the `PerformerID` for a `Performer` (a human that does things). This `PerformerID` will be used within the text file to declare who is performing what musical information.

For example, declare someone who will go by the ID `VN`.
```
P: VN
```

Then, declare the `Instruments` that are played by the declared `Performer` (e.g., a flutist may play their flute, and sing, while playing a kick drum, and controlling MaxMSP with a foot pedal). After the `PerformerID`, enter an `InstrumentID`, also an alphanumeric `String`, and the `InstrumentType` of this instrument (which must strictly match an item in this [list](https://github.com/jsbean/DNMKit/issues/18))

For example, a violinist, who is just playing Violin.
```
P: VN vn Violin
```

Add another performer: a cellist who is just playing Violoncello.

```Swift
P: VN vn Violin
P: VC vc Violoncello
```

Add another instrument to a performer's arsenal, perhaps a foot-pedal: 

```Swift
P: VN vn Violin
P: VC vc Violoncello cc ContinuousController
```

You can add any number of `Instruments` to a `Performer's` arsenal, just keep listing the pairs of `InstrumentID` and `InstrumentType` as necessary.

*Let me know if there is any clunkiness with the syntax highlighting.*

####Start a piece

`#` Add a Measure (you don't need to know the length, it gets calculated based on what's inside)

**Declare where to put a new event**
- `|` Start new rhythm on beat of current measure (optional if first rhythm of measure)
- `+` Start new rhythm after the last rhythm
- `-` Start new rhythm at the onset of the last rhythm (not supported yet, not tested)

**Start a rhythmic event**

`b s` Create a rhythmic container with the duration of Beats (`b`) and Subdivision value (`s`). Currently, only powers-of-two are allowed (`4, 8, 16, 32` etc...).

For example, `3 8`: Three eighth notes, or a dotted quarter.

At this point, we have only created a container of events, but we haven't actually create any events yet.

```Swift
# // start measure
| 3 8 // create dotted quarter rhythm container, starting on the downbeat

```

**Declare who is doing the rhythm**
```Swift
| 3 8 VN vn // PerformerID: VN, InstrumentID: vn (InstrumentType: Violin)
```

or

```Swift
| 3 8 VC cc // PerformerID: VC, InstrumentID: cc (InstrumentType: ContinuousController)
```

**Add events**

To add events, we indent and start with the relative durational value of an event.

```Swift
| 1 8 VN vn
    1 // relative durational value of 1
```

**Add ```Components``` to the rhythmic values**

**Top-level commands**
- `*` Rest
- `p` Pitch
    - Float values equivalent to MIDI values (60 = middle-c, 62 = d above middle-c)
- `a` Articulation
    - `>`
    - `.`
    - `-`
- `d` DynamicMarking
    - Any combination of values `opmf` (e.g., `fff`, `ppp`, `mp`, `offfp`)
    - Spanner{Start/Stop} `[`, `]`
- `(` Slur start
- `)` Slur stop
- `->` Start a durational extension ("tie") -- this will be deprecated soon, as it is superfluous
- `<-` Stop a durational extension ("tie")

```Swift
| 2 8 VN vn
    1 p 60 // do
    1 p 62 // re 
    1 p 64 // mi
```

In this case, we use the `p` command to declare a pitch value. Currently, MIDI values are the supported type. 

In the near future, string representations of pitch will be supported (e.g., `c_q#_up_4` = 60.75)

And a little more complicated:

```Swift
| 2 8 VN vn
    1 p 60 a > . d fff [
    1 p 62 a .
    1 p 64 a - d ppp ] ->

+ 1 8 // PerformerID and InstrumentID remembered here
    1 <-
```

<img src="/img/do_re_mi_plus.png" height="200">

```Swift
P: VN vn Violin
P: VC vc Violoncello

#
| 2 8 VN vn
    1 p 60 a > . d fff [
    1 p 62 a .
    1 p 64 a - d ppp ] ->

+ 1 8
    1 <-

| 3 8 VC vc
    4 p 55.25 a - d p [ (
    1 p 60.5 a - > d f ] [ ) ->
    2 --
        1 <-
        3 p 41 a > d pp ] (
        1 p 59.75 a . d pppp )


```

### Display the score on an iPad

Build and run **DNM_iOS**. Requires iOS / iphonesimulator 9.1. *If that doesn't work, file an issue.*

Sign in with the username and password you have set up (or create one).

If you have saved a score, the scores should show up on the left once you sign in.

Click on a score, it should load. Currently, it takes a long time to load, because everything is synchronous. That will be changed over time.
